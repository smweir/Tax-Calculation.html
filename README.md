This HTML document contains a simple JavaScript script that calculates tax based on a predefined income threshold. It determines whether an individual is required to pay taxes based on their income.

Features:
Income Threshold:
If the income is greater than or equal to $30,000, a tax of 15% is applied.
If the income is below $30,000, no tax is owed.

How It Works:
Income Declaration:
The variable x is set to 40,000, representing the individual's income.

Tax Calculation:
The script checks if the income is greater than or equal to $30,000.
If true, it logs "You must pay 15% tax" to the console.
If false, it logs "You don't have to pay any tax".
